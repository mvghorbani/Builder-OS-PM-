For a small-scale, personal-use system for a residential project like a concrete pour, the most effective process involves a combination of intelligent local search and highly personalized manual outreach. You can leverage publicly available business data and use automation sparingly to avoid the complexities of large-scale scraping and the risks associated with anti-bot measures. 
The most effective process: Manual local search with minimal automation
Step 1: Intelligent local business discovery
Instead of relying on web scraping, which is legally complex and technically challenging for a single, small-scale project, use manual searches on reliable, localized sources.
Source 1: Google Maps and Search: A simple search for "concrete pouring companies" or "concrete contractors" combined with your specific location (e.g., "concrete contractors near 75208") is the most direct method.
Pro-tip: The search results will often show companies with Google Business Profiles. This data is structured and reliable, including phone numbers, websites, and customer reviews.
Source 2: Yelp and HomeGuide: These are excellent for finding local contractors and reading reviews from past customers. For a residential project, reviews are more valuable than for a commercial job because they reflect the quality of work for homeowners.
Source 3: Better Business Bureau (BBB): Check a company's BBB rating for a general indicator of customer service and business standing. 
Step 2: Information synthesis and qualification
Create a simple, structured method for organizing the information from your manual search.
Use a spreadsheet: List potential contractors and note down key information:
Company Name: Found from search results.
Phone Number: Readily available on Google and review sites.
Website: Found in the business profile.
Reviews/Rating: Note the overall rating and any specific comments that seem relevant to your project.
Notes: Add your own thoughts on the company's website or any specific details.
Create a qualification checklist: Before outreach, make sure the contractors on your list are appropriate for your specific residential project.
Do they handle small residential jobs?
Do they offer free estimates?
Is their website professional, and do they show examples of similar work?
Step 3: Targeted and personalized outreach
Use the contact information to send personalized inquiries.
Create a detailed project description: Write a clear description of the needed work. Include measurements, the desired timeline, and any specific requirements. This saves time and ensures consistency across all inquiries.
Personalized email template: Use the information gathered in the spreadsheet to personalize each email.
Use the company name (e.g., "Hello [Company Name] Team").
Reference a specific detail from the company's website or a positive review (e.g., "I saw the excellent work on the XYZ project and was impressed...").
Attach or link to the project description and request a free estimate.
Automated scheduling: To manage time efficiently, use a tool like Calendly to schedule meetings with contractors for initial assessments or bids. Include the link in the email so contractors can book a time that works for them. 
Advantages of this approach for personal use
Avoids legal complexity: This does not violate any terms of service or privacy laws related to web scraping because the process is not automated.
High accuracy and relevance: Manual effort guarantees the contractors contacted are local and qualified for the specific job.
Builds trust: Personalized outreach shows that research has been done, increasing the likelihood that a busy contractor will take the request seriously.
Low cost and technical expertise: This process requires only time and standard tools (a browser, a spreadsheet, and an email account), with no need for complex and expensive scraping infrastructure.
